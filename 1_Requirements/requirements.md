## Introduction
 A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help calculate science, engineering, and mathematics problems. It has way more buttons than your standard calculator that just lets you do your four basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.we can now use calculator to  solve trigonometry problems involving sine, cosine, tangent, their inverses, and their hyperbolic functions. When working with trigonometric values, we can change the calculations between degrees, radians, and grads. Also, aslo we now have access to a button for Ï€ and Euler's constant, e. There are also buttons that allow you to easily calculate exponents to the second, third, or any other power.
## Features

This system supports following types of data conversions (For positive integers): 
1.Substraction(-),2.Addition(+),3.multiplication,4.divison,5.Power of a number, 5.logarithim 6.square root,7.sine
8.cosine 9.tangent 10.secant
